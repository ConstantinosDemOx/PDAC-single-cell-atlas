# PDAC-single-cell-atlas

Single-cell transcriptomics have transformed our understanding of the pancreatic cancer tumour microenvironment (TME). However, studies are limited to low number of patient donors and display significant variability in bioinformatic pipelines and cell type annotations. To address these limitations, we present an integrated pancreatic cancer single-cell atlas from 9 independent datasets spanning over 500,000 cells. This dataset captures extensive diversity across studies and clinical features, thus serving as reference for pancreatic cancer research. Through consensus clustering approaches, we identify more refined and robust cell states across major cell types associated with patient prognosis and metastasis. By using bulk and spatial transcriptomic data, we reveal four cellular ecosystems or ecotypes with distinct molecular features and clinical outcomes. We show that one ecotype defined by M2-like macrophages and dysfunctional CD8+ T cells predicts response to immune-checkpoint therapy but is resistant to chemotherapy. Our ecotype analysis may enable new patient stratification and therapeutic strategies.
